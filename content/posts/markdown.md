Welcome to my **test post**! This is a basic post written in Markdown to see how it renders on the blog.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It’s often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

### Key Features of Markdown

- **Headers**: You can create different levels of headers using `#` symbols.
- **Bold and Italics**: Format text as _italic_ or **bold**.
- **Lists**:
  - Bulleted lists
  - Numbered lists
- **Links**: [This is a link](https://example.com)
- **Images**: ![Test Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

## Code Example

Here’s an example of a code block:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
